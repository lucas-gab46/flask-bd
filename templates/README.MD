# py-payment - Template

This repository was created to be used in a Python project utilizing the Flask framework to create an payment visualization page with real-time notifications. The page is designed to notify the user when a payment is confirmed through another route in the Flask application. Here we have only the HTML and CSS of the template. The complete project can be found in another repository.
